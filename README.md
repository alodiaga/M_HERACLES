A toolbox with functions for processing point cloud data in the context of cultural heritage documentation.

The code was developped with the Matlab Computer Vision Toolbox installed (2018a), as well as third party dependencies:
- Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) by Wuming Zhang et al. (Zhang W, Qi J, Wan P, Wang H, Xie D, Wang X, Yan G. An Easy-to-Use Airborne LiDAR Data Filtering Method Based on Cloth Simulation. Remote Sensing. 2016; 8(6):501.): https://github.com/jianboqi/CSF
- M_MAP Toolbox by Rich Pawlowicz: https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html. Note that I used this because I don't have the Matlab Mapping Toolbox installed :(
